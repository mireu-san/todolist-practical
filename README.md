[Note] This is experimental repository. 

To do list (subtitle: test out array, js expression in typescript.)

# Objective:
1. Checkbox (true, false)
2. Keep the history = localstorage.
3. Put some framer-motion transition effect
4. Wallpaper
5. Responsive web page (for desktop, mobile view only.)
- Do not even think about adding more than three media query resolution. That is NOT responsive! Only TWO must exists. 

# Problem:
- Consider adding cancellation line to checked box. 
- Better to refer another todolist form.

# Tech note:
- uuidV4 is used in case of accidental mixture by generating a (future) new task.
